# 🎨 Getting Started

Welcome! You're about to build a real restaurant website using AI.

## What You'll Do

In the next 90 minutes, you'll:
1. Design your restaurant concept
2. Use AI to build the website  
3. Customize it to match your vision
4. Understand how containers power it all

No coding experience needed!

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- An AI assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- Your imagination!

## Let's Begin

### Step 1: Open the Starter Template

```bash
cd starter-template
```

This folder contains a basic Next.js restaurant template.

### Step 2: Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts:
- 🌐 Your website (port 3000)
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL database

### Step 3: Open Your Site

Visit: http://localhost:3000

You should see a basic restaurant website template.

###Step 4: Describe Your Restaurant

Open your AI assistant and tell it about your restaurant:

**Example:**
```
My restaurant is Rameshwaram Cafe. We serve authentic South Indian 
food - especially known for our filter coffee, crispy dosas, and 
soft idlis. I want warm orange colors like sunrise, and a 
traditional but modern feel.
```

**Your turn!** Describe:
- Restaurant name
- Type of food
- Special dishes
- Colors and atmosphere

### Step 5: Let AI Build It

Ask your AI:

```
Based on that description, customize the restaurant website in 
the starter-template folder. Update:
- Colors to match the theme
- Menu items with real dishes
- Homepage hero section
- About section with the restaurant story
```

### Step 6: See the Changes

Refresh http://localhost:3000

**Your restaurant website is coming to life!** 🎉

## What Just Happened?

- AI read your description
- Generated customized code
- Docker containers reloaded automatically
- Your site updated in real-time

This is **modern development**.

## Next Steps

- Add more menu items
- Change the layout
